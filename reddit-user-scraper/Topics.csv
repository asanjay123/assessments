It then closes and opens Spotify by the os module and plays it via pynput.

There have been a few programs in this subreddit which offer a similar functionality but mute spotify, and play another locally-stored song. I preferred not using that method and hence did this.

The code is present below, and is also present in my github repo [here](https://github.com/SakDev/SpotiByeBye).

Once again, I truly would appreciate any constructive feedback!

**Edit**: Thank you so much for your positive response!!!! I've added a readme file to help anyone understand the gist of setting up the Spotify API to get your Client ID and secret.

~~And to all the people who claim this is stealing, I just wanted to say that while it does test ethical bounds, this program merely restarts Spotify using legally-obtained data from Spotify.~~

AMA!",2496,otbvoj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/otbvoj/hello_world_im_al_sweigart_author_of_automate_the/,541,1627485107.0,"Howdy, y'all. I'm Al Sweigart (rhymes with ""why dirt""), author of ""Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"" and several other programming books. I release all of my books under a Creative Commons license, so you can read them for free on my website at https://inventwithpython.com

My latest books are [The Big Book of Small Python Projects](https://inventwithpython.com/bigbookpython/) and [Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python](https://inventwithpython.com/beyond/). I'm currently working on a book about recursion (the recursion jokes get funnier every time I hear them) which should be available in 2022. The ideas for this book grew into [a 2018 North Bay Python talk I gave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfBqVVKg4GE).

""Big Book"" contains the source code for 81 games, puzzles, simulations, and animations that were designed to be short and simple to understand. Folks tend to get caught up in repeating yet another ""hello world"" tutorial, but don't quite know how to apply the programming concepts they learned into actual programs. This book is full of source code that they can study to see how real-world programs work. They aren't just code snippets but actual, runnable programs. If you've been told you should ""work on your projects"" but don't know where to start, or if you've been told ""look at the source code of open source projects"" but found them undocumented and inscrutable, check out these programs.

""Beyond the Basic Stuff"" is a sort of follow up to ""Automate the Boring Stuff"" (or any other beginner Python resource). It goes into how professionals write code and best practices they follow. There's information on how to find help on your own, how to format your code and name your variables, an explanation of common programming jargon, the basics of Git, three chapters on object-oriented programming (and more importantly, when and why to use OOP), and more.

You've probably seen [my posts at the start of the month](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/obq0cg/automate_the_boring_stuff_with_python_online/) when I make my online Python course free. About 15,000 to 30,000 people sign up each month, though according to my stats only about 5% of people actually complete the course (which is typical for online courses, free or paid).

I got started writing programming books in 2009 when my then-girlfriend was a nanny for kid who wanted to learn to program. I started writing a book (which would become Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python) and self-published. People liked it, so I kept writing, and Automate was my first book through a traditional publisher, No Starch Press. I quit my software developer job in 2013 to finish writing Automate, thinking I'd get another software dev job in a year. But I kept having more ideas for other books, tutorials, videos, etc. so I'm still here writing.

Ask me anything! Post your questions and upvote questions you find interesting, and at 2pm central I'll begin replying.

EDIT (4:30pm Central) Wow, I've been typing nonstop for two and a half hours. I'm going to take a quick break and then keep going. Thanks for the questions, everyone!

EDIT 2: Oh yeah, I forgot to mention I'm also creating a 56-video Udemy course for the Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python book as well. [So far I only have the first 15 videos done, but you can watch them on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSrnLbioN6w&list=PL0-84-yl1fUmeV_2bBSguF_S0TVZk8wow)

EDIT (7:00pm) Heh, wow another two hours flew by. I'm going to drive home and then maybe answer a few more. Thanks again, everyone!

EDIT (10:30pm) Calling it a night. I'll probably answer a few more tomorrow, but I have to get back to work. Thanks again, everyone! Oh, and if you can help me out, writing an (honest) Amazon review for my books (especially the latest two) or even just sharing the links to the free online copies would be really help me get them in front of more people.",2021-07-28 10:11:47

109,It takes a village to build an open-source project and a single a**hole to demotivate everyone,2303,npkm6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/npkm6o/it_takes_a_village_to_build_an_opensource_project/,198,1622517968.0,"I am a contributor to Open-Source software([Jina](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina) \- an AI search framework) and I am annoyed with how some people make fun of the sheer hard work of open-source developers.

For the last 1 yr, we had made our contributors team meetings public(everyone could listen and participate during the meeting). And this is what happened in our last meeting - **While we were sharing news about upcoming Jina 2.0 release in the zoom meeting, some loud racist music starts playing automatically and someone starts drawing a d\*ck on the screen.**

[Video clip from the meeting - someone zoombombed at 00:25](https://reddit.com/link/npkm6o/video/8a16kolvlk271/player)

It was demotivating to say the least.

Building open-source project is challenging at multiple fronts other than the core technical challenges

* Understand what needs to be built
* Improve that continuously
* Help people understand the project
* Educate people about the domain
* Reach out people who might benefit from your project
* Collaborate with other contributors
* Deal with issues/PRs
* Deal with outdated versions/docs
* **Deal with different opinions**
* Sometimes deal with jerks like the ones who zoombombed us

The list is long! Open-source is hard!

Open-source exists because of some good people out there like you/me who care about the open-source so deeply to invest their time and energy for a little good for everyone else. It exists because of communities like r/python where we can find the support and the motivation. e.g. via this community, I came to know of many use cases of my project, problems and solutions in my project, and even people who supported me build it.

I wanted to vent out my negative experiences and wanted to say a big \*\*Thank you\*\* to you all open-source people, thanks to many(1.6k) contributors who made it possible for us to release \[Jina 2.0\]([https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/)) 🤗.

I'd want to know your opinion, how do you deal with such unexpected events and how do you keep yourself motivated as an open-source developer?",2021-05-31 22:26:08

117,I made a Finance Database with over 180.000 tickers to make Investment Decisions easier,2241,lcexoa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/lcexoa/i_made_a_finance_database_with_over_180000/,112,1612442964.0,"In my spare time I like to go through financial data to understand what kind of companies exist, how sectors and industries evolve and to test theoretical frameworks. However, I found that it required a lot of effort to figure out which companies belong to which industry and I often ran into paywalls that blocked me from accessing the exact data I was looking for. Platforms like Bloomberg offer such services but at ridiculous prices (up to $24.000 a year). This can make investment decisions for the retail investor rather difficult especially if you don't want to follow 'the herd'. **I wanted to change that.**

**Insert the** [**FinanceDatabase**](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceDatabase)**.** A database of over 180.000 symbols (80k+ companies, 15k+ ETFs, 30k+ Funds, 3k+ Cryptocurrencies and more) that is fully categorised per country, industry, sector, category and more. It features a 'Searcher' package (***pip install FinanceDatabase***) that has a user-friendly way of collecting the exact data you want (downloaded straight from the repository). For example, the following code returns all (listed) airlines in the United States (check [Examples](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceDatabase#Examples) for more info) :

    import FinanceDatabase as fd
    
    airlines_us = fd.select_equities(country='United States', industry='Airlines')

And the following gives insights in ETFs that have anything to do with 'semiconductor':

    import FinanceDatabase as fd
    
    all_etfs = fd.select_etfs()
    semiconductor_etfs = fd.search_products(all_etfs, 'semiconductor')

What I explicitly am *not* trying to do is re-invent the wheel (again) of Fundamental Data gathering as there are tons of packages out there that do that already (i.e. [FundamentalAnalysis](https://github.com/JerBouma/FundamentalAnalysis), [yfinance](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance), [sec-edgar](https://github.com/sec-edgar/sec-edgar)) but instead allow you to capture sector, industries, specific types of ETFs or cryptocurrencies that would have otherwise resulted in a lot of manual work. Then, when you have this sub-selection you can make use of the earlier mentioned packages.

**If you want to know what is available inside the Database, please have a look** [here](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceDatabase/tree/master/Database)**.** Alternatively, you can do the following (an example):

    import FinanceDatabase as fd
    
    equities_countries = fd.show_options('equities','countries') # or sector/industry
    etfs_categories = fd.show_options('etfs')
    cryptocurrencies = fd.show_options('cryptocurrencies')

I hope this can help some of you out making (better) investment decisions and all feedback (positive and negative) and contribution is much appreciated.

I am new to reddit, and after reading some posts of people expressing their frustration learning Python, I thought I would write about my own story on how learning Python helped save my life, and perhaps more importantly, gave my life meaning. I will try to be as brief as I can in my back story to keep this as relevant to Python as possible, but I feel it would be a disservice to leave it out completely, as my issues with mental health were a primary driver of the motivation I took advantage of to learn Python. I will post a more detailed description of my backstory later in r/addiciton or r/depression_help or something similar. Feel free to skip to the second \*\*\* to go straight to when I started learning python, however I suggest you read the whole post because honestly my whole story is relevant. If I hadn't gone through what I went through, I doubt I would have had the motivation to self-teach myself Python.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I grew up in a wealthy, extremely homogenous town within an hour of New York City. I went to a public school, but if you saw the way people dressed, it looked more like a private prep school. The vast majority of the kids in my school had parents who were millionaires. My parents were not. I was an only child, and I grew up in a small apartment on the ""poor"" side of town (""poor"" meaning houses/ apartments went for < 750k). As you can imagine, the social structure of the school was entirely based off the wealth of your parents. So the game was rigged against me from the beginning. I had very few friends at a young age, and most people in my middle school probably would have described me as a ""loser"" or another synonymous term. I was very unhappy and became addicted to video games as a mean to escape my life. During high school, I finally started branching out to meet people from the surrounding towns, who were not nearly as pretentious as the people I grew up with. I made a lot of friends and started to have a legitimate social life. However, with this new social life came a lot of superficiality and drinking/drug using. 

Until my senior year of high school, my grades were mediocre at best. Because I hated my social life at school, I hated school in general. But in my senior year, something changed. I won't detail it in this post, but will certainly get into it more in my next post in r/addiction or r/depression_help . I improved my grades and went to community college for my first year. I ended that year with a 3.9 GPA and an acceptance to one of the best colleges in my state. I transferred to that college and thought my life from there on out would be perfect. I was wrong.

I hated the social scene of my college. I found it to be very superficial and revolved almost entirely around drinking. Later I realized that while this was true for the people I was surrounding myself with, nobody forced me to surround myself with those people. I did it because I thought that this was the only way to enjoy college, and if I didn't, I would be missing out on the experience of my life. Man, what a load of BS I let myself believe. This expectation set me up for failure, and I blamed myself entirely. I thought I was worthless, a loser, and that all the mean things people said about me in my hometown back in middle school were true. I fell into a deep depression and eventually dropped out. 

Towards the end of my time away at this state school, I saw a psychiatrist who prescribed me Adderall and Xanax to treat my depression and learning disabilities. In the beginning, they worked wonders, but they certainly didn't solve the underlying issues, they actually made them worse. After I dropped out, I began to rely on them completely. Before long, I was blacking out all the time as a result of the Xanax, and up for days at a time as a result of the Adderall. It was always one or the other, and I had to use the other to counter the negative effects of one. 

For the next few years, I battled with addiction and depression to the point where I felt hopeless. I would get a week or two or three sober, then relapse. Somehow I managed to go back to a local college during this time, but my grades were mediocre, because I would miss a week of school every time I would relapse. Eventually I went away to rehab for four months. This is where I started to learn Python. I was very fortunate to have parents who loved me enough to spend the money to send me to a place for four months. I know not everyone has this privilege, and it is my goal to pay my parents back the money they spent on me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The rehab I went to was basically in the middle of nowhere, and while I was inpatient the first month, the last three months I was in what was essentially a nicer version of a sober house. I worked part- time at a restaurant (\~20 hours a week). I had computer access, and I found myself very bored during the first week or two, so I decided to learn something I had always wanted to learn: Programming. I bought a few courses off [udemy.com](https://udemy.com) for \~$12/each (NEVER pay full price of a Udemy course. You can always get them discounted), and started learning. Pretty much anytime I wasn't working or going to AA meetings, I was programming. I essentially replaced my addiction to drugs with an addiction to learning. I really enjoyed it, but in hindsight, I overdid it, as any addict does. I came home after four months, and I fell back into old patterns, and relapsed just before I would have been 6 months sober. I will go into more detail about this in my posts in r/addiction / r/depression_help .

During my time in rehab, I completed 3 Udemy courses on Python, but honestly I only really learned the fundamentals. I've never been a very quick learner, as I have a processing disorder (I was always the last one to finish tests in school and it always took me longer to do assignments etc). I frequently got frustrated, and rarely took breaks. I would spend 4-8 hours a day practicing coding, but much of that time was obsessing over one thing that I couldn't figure out. This was a big part of why I burnt myself out. Later, I found that if I ran into a problem I couldn't figure out, and forced myself to take a break, 95% of the time I would figure it out within 10 minutes of coming back from a 15-20 minute break. The mind is funny like that. 

Fast forward about 6 months and I was back in rehab, this time for only 30 days. I came home and luckily got an internship at a very small investment firm, where they used python to trade stocks algorithmically. There, I had a boss who was a very good programmer, and he gave me real projects to do that required me to think critically. He rarely gave me any help. Most of the time when I asked a question he would say ""I know the answer, but you have to figure it out. It's the only way you'll learn"". This frustrated me at the time, but looking back it was probably one of the best things anyone ever did for me. I developed resourcefulness and patience, two incredibly imperative skills for any programmer who wants to be worth his/her salt. During this time, I was taking a few classes at a local college to finally finish my degree, and I was working anywhere from 15-40 hours a week at this investment firm, unpaid. I honestly worked a bit too hard, I almost burnt myself out again, but I managed to get through it. I was very lucky in that my parents helped me financially during this time, which allowed me to focus more on school and work. I had a few relapses during this period, but they were short and mild, so it didn't throw me off track too badly. 

Over this past summer I finished up my degree (I majored in Business) and started looking for jobs. I was sure to put as much of my accomplishments at the small investment firm that involved python on my resume as I could. Covid was (and is) still wreaking havoc on the economy, so I worked extra hard applying to jobs, making connections, and keeping my skills sharp. I honestly probably applied to over 2500 jobs. I only got maybe 3-4 interviews. I had one during the end of the summer that went to the final round, and I was sure I was going to get the job. I didn't. Instead, the company (according to a connection I had made within the company cold-emailing people) decided to hire people from India to save money. I definitely felt pretty hopeless at that point. But I didn't give up. Maybe a month later, I got an interview for a job at a major company as a Data Analyst. I had three rounds of interviews plus I had to send them examples of some of my Python projects. I didn't get my hopes up like I did last time, out of fear of being disappointed. To my surprise, I got the job. I had asked for a 50k salary. They gave me 60k base plus a 5k bonus contingent on my performance, plus great benefits. 

I've been at this job for a little over a month, and I honestly love it. I find myself excited to go to work every day, and the people really like me because I am able to provide real value to the company. In my first month, I worked a lot on automation of otherwise very manual tasks (usually involving excel or emails). I would ask people how many hours per week they would generally spend on such a task and wrote it down. I recently did the math and realized that I have so far saved the company over 750 hours of work per year, and that’s a conservative estimate using a 48 week year (to account for holidays, vacation etc.) and the low end of their estimated range of hours per week. This frees the employees up to work on more value added (and frankly much more interesting) projects. My work there is just beginning, and there are a ton of projects I am really excited about.

I can honestly say I am happy now. I have over 4 months sober, and I rarely have any cravings to use drugs anymore. I really think this is largely because I found purpose in my life. That said, I still attend AA meetings often because I know I have to keep my sobriety my first priority. Without it, I have nothing. I also know that life isn't going to be perfect every day. While I do consider myself happy today, I still have bad days. Such is life. I stopped expecting to feel good all the time. Life is not designed that way. Before, I was only ""happy"" if I had a substance in my system. Also, ""happy"" to me was a euphoric rush which felt good, but was never fulfilling. Now I define happiness differently. It doesn't mean I feel good all the time. It means that despite sometimes not feeling good, I can appreciate how lucky I am to be alive and how blessed I am to have been given a second chance. Getting out of the rut that I found myself in a few years ago was the hardest thing I have ever done, but it was 100% worth it. At the risk of sounding corny, I really do believe sometimes you have to fall down hard and struggle getting back up to appreciate your life.

Learning Python was part of my journey, and it wasn't easy at all. When I started, I had a lot of doubts that I could do it. I didn't think ""people like me"" would be successful at something like this. Again, I was wrong. While I am certainly not even close to an expert at Programming/Python, I am good enough to be hired at a large company and good enough to make a difference. I'm sure there are people on Reddit and elsewhere that could make me look like I started programming last week. But I try not to compare myself to others. I instead try to compare myself to who I was before, and who I want to be in the future. As I’ve said several times before, I will make another post with more details about my experience with addiction/depression and give my general tips for life there, but for now here are my general tips for learning Python:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

1. I suggest starting with the fundamentals. I used Jose Portilla's Udemy course for this and it was great. I will link it at the bottom along with some other resources.

2. If you struggle motivating yourself to follow online courses, try figuring out a real project to do that can actually help you in everyday life. This could be automating something you do in your job, for school, or just something you think will be fun. 

3. Work Hard. Don't give up. But don't burn yourself out. Take frequent breaks, especially when you get frustrated. 

4. Ask for help. If you’re struggling with a specific problem, r/learnpython is great, along with [Stackoverflow.com](https://Stackoverflow.com) . People have helped me with many problems there.

5. Trust the Process. Programming is a lot like learning an instrument in my opinion. At first it can be grueling and you won’t be able to do much for a while, but after you learn the fundamentals, it becomes incredibly enjoyable. 

6. Be consistent. This is extremely important. Try to set aside a time every day to practice. Even if it’s only 20-30 minutes. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There are many more tips that I have but those are the most important ones I can think of. Please feel free to follow me as I hope to be quite active on reddit in the future. If you have any questions, please message me. Whether it's about Python, Addiction, Depression, or whatever else. I'll do my best to answer everyone I can.

What to learn next is an often asked question. [Searching for `what next` on /r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/search?q=what+next&restrict_sr=on) gives you too many results. Here's some more Q&A and articles on this topic:

## Exercises and Projects

I do not have a simple answer to this question either. If you feel comfortable with programming basics and Python syntax, then exercises are a good way to test your knowledge. The resource you used to learn Python will typically have some sort of exercises, so those would be ideal as a first choice. I'd also suggest using the below resources to improve your skills. If you get stuck, reread the material related to those topics, search online, ask for clarifications, etc  — in short, make an effort to solve it. It is okay to skip some troublesome problems (and come back to it later if you have the time), but you should be able to solve most of the beginner problems. Maintaining notes will help too, especially for common mistakes.

* [Exercism](https://exercism.io/tracks/python/exercises), [Practicepython](https://www.practicepython.org/), [Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenges/python3) — these are all beginner friendly and difficulty levels are marked
* [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/), [Adventofcode](https://adventofcode.com/), [Projecteuler](https://projecteuler.net/) — more challenging
* [Checkio](https://py.checkio.org/), [Codingame](https://www.codingame.com/start), [Codecombat](https://codecombat.com/play/level/dungeons-of-kithgard) — gaming based challenges
* [/r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer) — not active currently, but there's plenty of past challenges with discussions

Once you are comfortable with basics and syntax, the next step is projects. I use a 10-line program that solves a common problem for me — adding `body { text-align: justify }` to `epub` files that are not justify aligned. I didn't know that this line would help beforehand, I searched online for a solution and then automated the process of unzipping `epub`, adding the line and then packing it again. That will likely need you to lookup documentation and go through some stackoverflow Q&A as well. And once you have written the solution and use it regularly, you'll likely encounter corner cases and features to be added. I feel this is a great way to learn and understand programming.

## Debugging

Knowing how to debug your programs is crucial and should be ideally taught right from the beginning instead of a chapter at the end of the book. [Think Python](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) is an awesome example for such a resource material.

Sites like [Pythontutor](http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit) allow you to visually debug a program — you can execute a program step by step and see the current value of variables. Similar feature is typically provided by IDEs like [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and [Thonny](https://thonny.org/). Under the hood, these visualizations are using the [pdb module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html). See also [Python debugging with pdb](https://realpython.com/python-debugging-pdb/).

Debugging is often a frustrating experience. Taking a break helps (and sometimes I have found the problem in my dreams). Try to reduce the code as much as possible so that you are left with minimal code necessary to reproduce the issue. Talking about the problem to a friend/colleague/inanimate-objects/etc can help too — known as [Rubber duck debugging](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/). I have often found the issue while formulating a question to be asked on forums like stackoverflow/reddit because writing down your problem is another way to bring clarity than just having a vague idea in your mind. Here's some more articles on this challenging topic:

* [What does debugging a program look like?](https://jvns.ca/blog/2019/06/23/a-few-debugging-resources/)
* [How to debug small programs](https://ericlippert.com/2014/03/05/how-to-debug-small-programs/)
* [Debugging guide](https://uchicago-cs.github.io/debugging-guide/)
* [Problem solving skills](https://ryanstutorials.net/problem-solving-skills/)

Here's an interesting snippet (modified to keep it small) from a collection of [interesting bug stories](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/169713/whats-the-toughest-bug-you-ever-found-and-fixed).

>A jpeg parser choked whenever the CEO came into the room, because he always had a shirt with a square pattern on it, which triggered some special case of contrast and block boundary algorithms.

See also [curated list of absurd software bug stories](https://500mile.email/).

## Testing

Another crucial aspect in the programming journey is knowing how to write tests. In bigger projects, usually there are separate engineers (often in much larger number than code developers) to test the code. Even in those cases, writing a few sanity test cases yourself can help you develop faster knowing that the changes aren't breaking basic functionality.

There's no single consensus on test methodologies. There is [Unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing), [Integration testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing), [Test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) and so on. Often, a combination of these is used. These days, machine learning is also being considered to reduce the testing time, see [Testing Firefox more efficiently with machine learning](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/07/testing-firefox-more-efficiently-with-machine-learning/) for example.

When I start a project, I usually try to write the programs incrementally. Say I need to iterate over files from a directory. I will make sure that portion is working (usually with `print` statements), then add another feature — say file reading and test that and so on. This reduces the burden of testing a large program at once at the end. And depending upon the nature of the program, I'll add a few sanity tests at the end. For example, for my [command_help](https://github.com/learnbyexample/command_help) project, I copy pasted a few test runs of the program with different options and arguments into a separate file and wrote a program to perform these tests programmatically whenever the source code is modified.

For non-trivial projects, you'll usually end up needing frameworks like built-in module `unittest` or third-party modules like `pytest`. See [Getting started with testing in Python](https://realpython.com/python-testing/) and [calmcode: pytest](https://calmcode.io/pytest/introduction.html) for discussion on these topics.

I was inspired to make this after finding that applications like Excel, Tableau and JMP were often quicker than Python for ad hoc viewing, plotting and reshaping. This project aims to make basic EDA easy but also allows you to easily move DataFrames in memory between the GUI and IPython so you still have the full power of Pandas. It's made with PyQt5 and renders in a standalone window compatible with any IDE.

190,I just automated an actual job I have at work.,1841,j1lk03,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/j1lk03/i_just_automated_an_actual_job_i_have_at_work/,166,1601329114.0,"Spent 5 hours coding for what could have been hundreds of hours of work. I can't believe I actually did it. Lol

Of course I did it with the help of my google-fu but the fact that I was able to do it is such a great feeling of accomplishment. Received a ""Great Work!"" message from my boss too.


EDIT: HERE'S WHAT I DID. I kinda messed up not including this in the main post.

Basically I needed to make comparison of a new cloned server vs our old one.

It has hundreds if not thousand of tables that I'll need to do binary check sums of to ensure that the newly created servers and dbs are completely identical and that the etl procedures are loading the data correctly with the correct data types and values etc.

So without automation I'll have to do this hundreds if not thousands of times manually:

Run checksum code on old server then run on old server, save the checksum results on an excel worksheet as documentation if they or did not match.

What I did is I created a python automation program that gets a list of all tables in a db within a server, then iterates over all those tables and executes the binary check sum query again and again using the tables on a list then saves all the query result on a csv file. 

I appended the csv output names with the server name to make them distinct after every run. Then I load that csv to an excel file and then do the final IF comparisons there. 

So instead of doing that manual comparison for hundreds of hours, I was able to do it in 5 hours of coding and now runs for 30 second per database then voila, instant results. 

I'm so proud of this not gonna lie.",2020-09-28 16:38:34

No-one going through the trade school learns anything on computers beyond making graphs in excel. 

I however always have had some interest in programming, so i took some free course a while back and try to find areas of my life where i can automate the boring stuff. I have very limited knowledge of any of the advanced functions, but i understand some of the basic logic.

For my job, i also have a computer because i oversee a large number of projects, every project gets a folder, an excel spreadsheet (a gantt chart for each project). 

I managed to make a script that asks for project number, checks of the folder is there, copies and modifies the cells of the excel sheet to the correct project number etc. I had to google almost everything, how do i folder scan? how do i manipulate excel? etc etc. 

They actually believe I performed black magic.

## What is PyBoy

In short, it’s a Game Boy emulator written from scratch in pure Python, with additional support for scripting through an API. We’ve added type definitions, which allows us to compile the software using Cython to get performance comparable to emulators written in C and C++.

## Installation

The installation instructions are simple: Install SDL2 on your system, and install PyBoy through `pip install pyboy`. If you need to compile from source, we also have detailed instructions on the GitHub Wiki for Mac, Linux and Windows.

[https://github.com/Baekalfen/PyBoy/wiki/Installation](https://github.com/Baekalfen/PyBoy/wiki/Installation)

## Features

PyBoy is designed to be accessible from Python, so we support and encourage people who want to make experiments, bots or AI’s to try it out. We are building game-specific wrappers, which at the moment allows programmers to interface with Tetris and Super Mario Land, without any intricate knowledge of the Game Boy. Documentation can be found at: [https://docs.pyboy.dk](https://docs.pyboy.dk/) .

We also want to learn and experiment with more exotic features. Based on work from a university project, we’ve added rewinding to the emulator. Which means, you’ll be able to turn back time in any game.

It's amazing and kind of confusing, but crazy none the less.

Recently I had to integrate Python as a scripting language into a large c++ project and though I should get to know the language first. And let me tell you, it's simply magical.

""I can add properties to classes dynamically? And delete them?"" ""Functions don't even care about the number of arguments?"" ""Need to do something? There's a library for that.""

It's absolutely crazy. And I love it. I have to be honest, the most amazing about this is how easy it is to embed.

I could give Python the project's memory allocator and the interpreter immediately uses the main memory pool of the project. I could redirect the interpreter's stdout / stderr channels to the project as well. Extending the language and exposing c++ functions are a breeze.

Python essentially supercharges c++.

Now, I'm not going to change my preference of c/c++ any time soon, but I just had to make a post about how nicely Python works as a scripting language in a c++ project. Cheers",2020-05-02 08:13:13

While I was explaining my logic, I made sure I was emphasizing the letter 't' whenever I pronounced myDict (so that it doesn't sound like my\_dick). Anyway, while I was typing the solution and explaining, obviously, my brain started concentrating on the code and I wasn't paying much attention to what I was saying. Apparently, my pronunciation started sounding like 'my dick'. On top of that, I was using that dick so much to the point that interviewer started laughing.

You can also click this link or manually enter the code: DEC2020FREE

This promo code works until the 4th (I can't extend it past that). Sometimes it takes an hour or so for the code to become active just after I create it, so if it doesn't work, go ahead and try again a while later. I'll change it to DEC2020FREE2 on the 4th.

Udemy has changed their coupon policies, and I'm now only allowed to make 3 coupon codes each month with several restrictions. Hence why each code only lasts 3 days. **I won't be able to make codes after this period**, but I will be making free codes next month.

You can also purchase the course at a discount using my code DEC2020 or clicking https://inventwithpython.com/automateudemy to redirect to the latest discount code. I have to manually renew this each month (until I get that automation script done). And the cheapest I can offer the course is about $16 to $18. (Meanwhile, this lets Udemy undercut my discount by offering it for $12, and I don't get the credit for those referral signups. Blerg.)

**Frequently Asked Questions:** (*read this before posting questions*)

* This course is for beginners and assumes no previous programming experience, but the second half is useful for experienced programmers who want to learn about various third-party Python modules.
* If you don't have time to take the course now, that's fine. Signing up gives you lifetime access so you can work on it at your own pace.
* This Udemy course covers roughly the same content as the 1st edition book (the book has a little bit more, but all the basics are covered in the online course), which you can read for free online at https://inventwithpython.com
* The 2nd edition of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is free online: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/
* I do plan on updating the Udemy course for the second edition, but it'll take a while because I have other book projects I'm working on. Expect that update to happen in mid-2021. If you sign up for this Udemy course, you'll get the updated content automatically once I finish it. It won't be a separate course.
* It's totally fine to start on the first edition and then read the second edition later. I'll be writing a blog post to guide first edition readers to the parts of the second edition they should read.
* I wrote a blog post to cover [what's new in the second edition](https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2019/10/07/whats-new-in-the-2nd-edition-of-automate-the-boring-stuff-with-python/)
* **You're not too old to learn to code. You don't need to be ""good at math"" to be good at coding.**
* Signing up is the first step. Actually finishing the course is the next. :) [There are several ways to get/stay motivated.](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq#wiki_how_can_i_get.2Fstay_motivated_to_learn_programming.3F) I suggest getting a ""gym buddy"" to learn with.",2020-12-01 13:22:32

Now, I am reasonably skilled in python, I believe. Don't write OOP and class-based python unless I am doing more than 100 lines of code. Most often write pretty simple stuff but most of the time goes into problem-solving.

But I despise freelancing. 1 out of every 3 comments/posts I make on Reddit is how much I hate doing freelancing. I come to Reddit to vent so I am sorry to the fellas who is reading this because they are more or less my punching bag :( I am sorry sir/madam. I am just having a bad life, it will end soon.

So, today I am going to rant about one of the more """"fun"""" things of freelancing, client telling me they know python.

Whenever a client tells me that they know python, I try to ignore them but often times I have to entertain the idea anyway because jobs are scarce. I keep telling myself ""maybe this will work out great"" but it doesn't.

It never goes right. Here is the thing. If you do what I do you will realize the code is often quite simple. Most of the effort goes into problem-solving. So when the client sees the code and me getting paid by the hour, ""They are like I thought you are *best darn python developer* I could have written that myself!""

My immediate impulse is to go on a rant and call that person something rotten. But I have to maintain ""professionalism"".

Then there is the issue of budgeting. I do fixed payment contracts for smaller engagements. But oftentimes these python experts will quote me something that is at least one-fourth of a reasonable budget. And by reasonable I mean non-US reasonable budget which is already one-fifth of a reasonable US programming project budget. But anyway they quote that because they know how is easy it is to do my job.

There is more because this is rant by the way. So, clients with python knowledge will say to me ""I have this python file..."" which is the worst thing to say at this point. They think they have done the ""majority"" of the work. But here is the way I see it-

a. Either they have just barely scratched the surface
b. They have a jumbled up mess
c. They had another dev look into the project who already failed
d. They had to do a ""code review"" of their previous freelancer and they ended up stealing the code

There is no positive way to imagine this problem. I have seen too much crappy code and too much of arguments like ""they had done the work for me, so I should charge near to nothing"".

People don't know exactly why senior devs get paid so much money. Junior devs write code, senior devs review code. That is why they get paid more. Making sense of other people's code is a risky and frustrating thing and it could be incredibly time-consuming. And moreover in most cases building upon a codebase is more difficult than writing it from the scratch.

Doctors rant about ""expert"" patients earning their MDs from WebMD and I am seeing the exact same thing happen to me with clients knowing how to write loops in python.

Python is easy to learn, programming these days is easy to learn. But people are not paying programmers for writing loops and if statements. They are paying them to solve problems. Knowing the alphabet doesn't make you a poet. And yes in my eyes programming is poetry.",2020-11-01 14:27:49

My friend and I are building [Devbook](https://usedevbook.com). It’s a desktop app that allows you to search in Stack Overflow, search and read documentation, and search public code on GitHub from a single place. The whole app can be controlled just using a keyboard. No need to use your mouse. This way, it’s easier to stay in the flow.

The app works similarly to Spotlight on macOS. You hit a global shortcut and Devbook appears as an overlay over the currently active app. This way you minimalize the needed context switching when looking up information. You almost don't leave your coding editor.

You can think about Devbook as a search engine made just for developers. But no ads, content marketing, SEO, etc.

I thought the community here might find it useful. Currently, we support Python, Flask, Django docs, and adding more with time.

Give it a try and let me know what you think!

**EDIT**

Some folks have been asking us for the pricing. Devbook is free. The plan is to build team features later on and have subscriptions for teams and organizations. If it will be possible, we want to always have a free plan for solo developers.

However, if you really want to support us, I just set up the [Buy Me A Coffee page](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/P8dyVmoAF) for Devbook. You can donate a small amount if you feel comfortable. It will probably make us jump around from the excitement since it would be our first revenue:)

**EDIT 2**

Oh, boy did this blow-up! Every week, we just share Devbook in various subreddits we think might enjoy it. We didn't expect to blow it up that much at all. Thank you all folks for trying Devbook out. It means a lot.

&#x200B;

For the near future Devbook release, we're building an extensions system that will allow you to add search functionality we don't support out of the box. Imagine Google customizable through vscode-like extensions. You can read more [here](https://github.com/DevbookHQ/devbook-extension).

You can also click this link or manually enter the code: COPSHOTMEINPORTLAND2

https://www.udemy.com/course/automate/?couponCode=COPSHOTMEINPORTLAND2

This promo code works until August 4th (I can't extend it past that). Sometimes it takes an hour or so for the code to become active just after I create it, so if it doesn't work, go ahead and try again a while later. I'll change it to COPSHOTMEINPORTLAND2 on the 4th.

Udemy has changed their coupon policies, and I'm now only allowed to make 3 coupon codes each month with several restrictions. Hence why each code only lasts 3 days. **I won't be able to make codes after this period**, but I will be making free codes next month. [Meanwhile, the first 15 of the course's 50 videos are free on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F_OgqRuSdI&list=PL0-84-yl1fUnRuXGFe_F7qSH1LEnn9LkW)

You can also purchase the course at a discount using my code COPSHOTMEINPORTLAND2 or clicking https://inventwithpython.com/automateudemy to redirect to the latest discount code. I have to manually renew this each month (until I get that automation script done). And the cheapest I can offer the course is about $16 to $18. (Meanwhile, this lets Udemy undercut my discount by offering it for $12, and I don't get the credit for those referral signups. Blerg.)

**Frequently Asked Questions:** (*read this before posting questions*)

* This course is for beginners and assumes no previous programming experience, but the second half is useful for experienced programmers who want to learn about various third-party Python modules.
* If you don't have time to take the course now, that's fine. Signing up gives you lifetime access so you can work on it at your own pace.
* This Udemy course covers roughly the same content as the 1st edition book (the book has a little bit more, but all the basics are covered in the online course), which you can read for free online at https://inventwithpython.com
* The 2nd edition of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is now available online: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/
* I do plan on updating the Udemy course for the second edition, but it'll take a while because I have other book projects I'm working on. Expect that update to happen in mid- or late-2020. If you sign up for this Udemy course, you'll get the updated content automatically once I finish it. It won't be a separate course.
* It's totally fine to start on the first edition and then read the second edition later. I'll be writing a blog post to guide first edition readers to the parts of the second edition they should read.
* I wrote a blog post to cover [what's new in the second edition](https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2019/10/07/whats-new-in-the-2nd-edition-of-automate-the-boring-stuff-with-python/)
* **You're not too old to learn to code. You don't need to be ""good at math"" to be good at coding.**
* Signing up is the first step. Actually finishing the course is the next. :) [There are several ways to get/stay motivated.](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq#wiki_how_can_i_get.2Fstay_motivated_to_learn_programming.3F) I suggest getting a ""gym buddy"" to learn with.",2020-08-01 12:30:07

There's a great package called ConfigParser which you can use which simplifies creating config files (like the windows .ini files) so that it takes as much effort as hardcoding!  You can get into the hang of using that instead and it should both help your code more scalable, AND help with making your code a bit more maintainble as well (it'll force you to have better config paramters names)

We're a little two-person team (Angie and Jem). We're bootstrapping and self-funded. I'm the programmer.

I wanted to share it because it was a fun and interesting project to build, and Python made it possible for us to get a long way as a small team. It uses serverless on the backend (AWS). We're using Spacy and GPT-2, and some PyTorch models. It uses BeautifulSoup for spidering/crawling/content retrieval. The front-end is React.

It has a different type of user interface to any other search engine, as it is chat based. And it lets you choose how you view results, either visually like an Instagram feed or cards, or minimal like Hacker News or the old Google. It tries to fight SEO spam and strips out ads and ad-tech from search results.

We have a project on GitHub with Jupyter notebooks and sample data with experiments and scripts, including examples of querying other search APIs, and to generate example utterances programatically to use for NLP models with sources like Wikipedia, StackOverflow and Wolfram|Alpha:

TLDW: When I want to **automate actions on a site**, such as logins or forms, or scraping pages with JavaScript, **I manually** inspect each web element I need and begin writing a script.

***I'm lazy though*** and had the idea to automate the creation of these automation/testing scripts. And thus ""Sillynium"" was born.

Sillynium allows you to **draw boxes around the elements you require** on a page and automatically gets the element and its properties for you. Different coloured rectangles tell the program you want to do different things. Eg: Red means ""Input text"", Green means ""Click button"".

**When you've finished drawing boxes, a working python selenium script is generated**. If you run that script, it does exactly what you told it to do! All this without you writing any code, and losing time.

I made this project over the course of a day as a quick and dirty proof of concept. Its very flawed in its current iteration (taking a screenshot of webpage), so V2 I'm trying to figure out how to draw directly to the browser. Critique it and rip it to shreds. I'm aware of browser recorders btw so I know those exist, this is my twist on automation

**Edit**: I was not prepared for the amount of interest in this little proof of concept! So thank you all very much for your time you’ve made my day :)

In the interest of transparency and to answer your questions about the code and my plans:

I originally thought about monetisation (web extension etc) after finishing this POC (\*\*sigh i know I’m a greedy bastard) but now I’m in 2 minds about it!

On the one hand I want to make it free for personal use, on the other hand I’d like to potentially charge for commercial use (once its finished).

*Final edit 2* The community has spoken, I WILL BE RELEASING THIS VERSION AS OPEN SOURCE! I did some light refactoring, and have added it to a repo which will be shared in a follow up. It shows the POC and the community is welcome to build on the original idea :)

I learned Python in 1998, and I used it pretty much daily through my working life. Its connectivity with everything has allowed me to do all kinds of interesting and fun things. When I discovered that the [AxiDraw](http://www.axidraw.com/) pen plotter has a [Python binding](https://github.com/inconvergent/axidraw-xy), I decided to try writing in my own handwriting with my own pen. Something I've been unable to do for years.

It has taken a lot, mostly because I can't type, so I've been limited to voice recognition and copy and paste, but the letter linked above is where I got to this evening.

I thought I would share my mini triumph.

I've learned and programmed in a lot of different languages over the years. I have written several languages myself. And even though Python wasn't my first language, it is the first language I consider for any new project. I'd have to have a compelling reason to use something else. So thank you, Python, for making this possible.

</ shameless preaching to the choir> ;)

Edit: In the comments a couple of people asked for a video. I will make a proper video with the AxiDraw as soon as I can. [We just did a quick test](https://youtu.be/W5YGwNlO53A) on my wife's Cricut craft cutter. It works there too, though you can't tilt the pen or change the pressure.

I finally published my updated version of **Python regular expressions** ebook. My initial motivation was to add **epub** format and separate out **third-party regex** module content into a separate chapter. An email exchange with a reader, a look at feedback from the past year and my own improvements as a writer resulted in a significant overhaul. It took me about 6 weeks to complete the revision instead of 1-2 weeks that I estimated. Sounds familiar right? I’m definitely pleased with the changes, but along the way I added a long list of TODOs that will probably need months of work. Future me is not going to be pleased.

To get pdf/epub versions, use any of these links:

* https://gumroad.com/l/py_regex
* https://leanpub.com/py_regex

As a bundle (Python/Ruby/JS regex and grep/sed/awk cli tools):

* https://gumroad.com/l/regex
* https://leanpub.com/b/regex

I made **all my books free** at the end of March when the pandemic hit my country. The virus doesn’t seem to be going away anytime soon, so I’ll probably start charging again after I finish updating the Ruby and JS regex books. You can still pay if you wish.

You can read the entire book from the GitHub repo - https://github.com/learnbyexample/py_regular_expressions. The repo also contains the code snippets used in the book and a handy way to access all the exercises in a single file. You can also find the solutions there. 

**Edit (Aug 2020):** Web version of the book - https://learnbyexample.github.io/py_regular_expressions/ 

I’d highly appreciate your feedback. That’s been a major motivating factor to keep writing as well as for improving the content.

Here’s the issue: the name that keeps getting floated is ‘Typed Python’. Forgive me, but that name sucks and has no character. A language invented while Clinton was President by a guy with one of the 3 coolest first names you can have, and named after a sketch comedy show deserves better than this.

Thus, I would like to propose a simpler name; one that is more ‘pythonic’ if you will. If we just exchange the positions of the “P” and the “T” we evoke the same idea (in addition to making it wonderfully Google-able) and get the name:

**Typhon**


**EDIT**: I failed to mention and have since learned that Typhon and Python both come from Greek Mythology—and both were serpant giants. Typhon battled Zeus and Python battled Apollo. Python was memorialized by having a big snake named after him. Typhon still awaits his big come up (*which is why I have gathered you all here today*).

335,Enable ++x and --x expressions in Python,1415,pnie05,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/pnie05/enable_x_and_x_expressions_in_python/,85,1631548897.0,"By default, Python supports neither pre-increments (like `++x`) nor post-increments (like `x++`), commonly used in other languages. However, the first ones are *syntactically correct* since Python parses them as two subsequent `+x` operations, where `+` is the unary plus operator (same with `--x` and the unary minus). They both have no effect, since in practice `-(-x) == +(+x) == x`.

I'd like to share the [plusplus](https://github.com/borzunov/plusplus) module that turns the `++x`\-like expressions into `x += 1` at the bytecode level, using pure Python only.

Unlike `x += 1`, `++x` is still an expression, so the increments work fine inside other expressions, `if`/`while` conditions, lambda functions, and list/dict comprehensions:

    array[++index] = new_value
    
    if --connection.num_users == 0:
        connection.close()
    
    button.add_click_callback(lambda: ++counter)
    
    index = 0
    indexed_cells = {++index: cell for row in table for cell in row}

**Note:** I don't claim that allowing increments is good for real projects (it may confuse new developers and give opportunities to write less readable code), though some situations when they simplify the code do exist. I've made this module for fun, as a demonstration of Python flexibility and bytecode manipulation techniques.

The module works by replacing the bytecode patterns corresponding to the `++x` and `--x` expressions with the bytecode for actual incrementing. For example, this is what happens for the `y = ++x` line:

[Two consecutive UNARY\_POSITIVE instructions are replaced with adding one and storing the result back to the original place](https://preview.redd.it/2k692gaulan71.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b440b0cf9bc2bae5a2695f1831a810f0d5f55d4)

It's not always that simple: incrementing object attributes and collection items requires much trickier bytecode manipulation (see the [""How it works""](https://github.com/borzunov/plusplus#how-it-works) section in the docs for details).

To use the module, you can just run `pip install plusplus` and add two lines of code enabling the increments. You may do this for just one function or for the whole package you're working on (see the [""How to use it?""](https://github.com/borzunov/plusplus#how-to-use-it) section).

**Updates:**

* The same approach could be used to implement the assignment expressions for the Python versions that don't support them. For example, we could replace the `x <-- value` expressions (two unary minuses + one comparison) with actual assignments (setting `x` to `value`).
* See also [cpmoptimize](https://kukuruku.co/post/automatic-algorithms-optimization-via-fast-matrix-exponentiation/) \- my older project about Python bytecode manipulation. It optimizes loops calculating linear recurrences, reducing their time complexity from O(n) to O(log n).

For this reason I implemented this basic packet sniffer using just built-in libraries and fully compatible with Python 3.x. It is implemented in OOP, leverages libraries like ctypes, socket, argparse and others and relies on the use of abstract base classes, inheritance, special methods, decorators and design patterns (command, observer and  template). We also employ some manipulation of binary and hexadecimal values that are formatted for the use on raw sockets.

This tool is part of an upcoming (though not nearly ready) series of video tutorials I plan to launch some time in the next year. It might be a rather long course given how much we'd need to cover about all the underlying networking and programming topics.

It's available on GitHub. Use wisely.

## Introduction

JustPy is an object-oriented, component based, high-level Python Web Framework that requires no front-end programming. With a few lines of only Python code, you can create interactive websites without any JavaScript programming.

Unlike other web frameworks, JustPy has no front-end/back-end distinction. All programming is done on the back-end allowing a simpler, more productive, and more Pythonic web development experience. JustPy removes the front-end/back-end distinction by intercepting the relevant events on the front-end and sending them to the back-end to be processed.

In JustPy, elements on the web page are instances of component classes. A component in JustPy is a Python class that allows you to instantiate reusable custom elements whose functionality and design is encapsulated away from the rest of your code.

Custom components can be created using other components as building blocks. Out of the box, JustPy comes with support for [HTML](https://justpy.io/#/tutorial/html_components) and [SVG](https://justpy.io/#/tutorial/svg_components) components as well as more complex components such as [charts](https://justpy.io/#/charts_tutorial/introduction) and [grids](https://justpy.io/#/grids_tutorial/introduction).  It also supports most of the components and the functionality of the [Quasar](https://quasar.dev/) library of [Material Design 2.0](https://material.io/) components.

JustPy encourages creating your own components and reusing them in different projects (and, if applicable, sharing these components with others).

JustPy supports visualization using [matplotlib](https://justpy.io/#/tutorial/matplotlib) and [Highcharts](https://justpy.io/#/charts_tutorial/introduction).

JustPy integrates nicely with [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and simplifies building web sites based on pandas analysis. JustPy comes with a [pandas extension](https://justpy.io/#/charts_tutorial/pandas?id=using-the-pandas-extension) that makes it simple to create interactive charts and grids from pandas data structures.

## Hello World!

    import justpy as jp
    
    def hello_world():
        wp = jp.WebPage()
        d = jp.Div(text='Hello world!')
        wp.add(d)
        return wp
        
    jp.justpy(hello_world)

The program above activates a web server that returns a web page with 'Hello world!' for any request. Locally, you would direct your browser to [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) or http://localhost:8000/ or  to see the result.

Here is a slightly modified version in which 'Hello world!' changes to 'I was clicked!' when it is clicked.

    import justpy as jp
    
    def my_click(self, msg):
        self.text = 'I was clicked!'
    
    def hello_world():
        wp = jp.WebPage()
        d = jp.Div(text='Hello world!')
        d.on('click', my_click)
        wp.add(d)
        return wp
    
    jp.justpy(hello_world)

Many other examples can be found in the [tutorial](https://justpy.io/#/tutorial/getting_started)

## Under the Hood

JustPy's backend is built using:

* [starlette](https://www.starlette.io/) \- ""a lightweight [ASGI](https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) framework/toolkit, which is ideal for building high performance asyncio services"".
* [uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/) \- ""a lightning-fast [ASGI](https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) server, built on [uvloop](https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop) and [httptools](https://github.com/MagicStack/httptools)"".

JustPy's frontend (which is transparent to JustPy developers) is built using:

* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) \- ""The Progressive JavaScript Framework""

The way JustPy removes the frontend/backend distinction is by intercepting the relevant events on the frontend and sending them to the backend to be processed.

**THE SITUATION**

My son came into the world last month and, as first time parents, we've had a hard time handling his hectic feeding schedule. He would burst into screams, and we'd scramble to get a bottle prepared/warmed. However there wasn't a very good way to know how much milk to warm (once you heat it, it has to be either consumed or discarded). And since a bottle takes 5+ minutes to heat up, we'd spend that time fumbling to soothe him until it was ready. After one-to-two weeks of this, I decided to do something about it.

That's why I created a Python project to take out the guesswork! From the beginning, we were logging all of his feeds because we wanted to make sure he was eating enough (and wasn't eating too much). We use a shared Google Keep note because that's the easiest/quickest way to do it on our phones. And since we'd already gotten into the habit of logging data, I figured 'why not use it to predict when the next bottle will be demanded?'

**WHAT IT DOES**

The program scrapes all of the content from the Google Keep note and then uses it to estimate the next feed. This estimation includes not only the time, but also the quantity of milk to prepare. It's based on the patterns exhibited over the prior three days, and takes into account both his bottle feeds and his direct breastfeeds. My original goal was to create a legitimate predictive model of his feed patterns, but it quickly became apparent that an explicit model wouldn't be the best strategy (largely due to the irregularity of the feed time data points).

Once it has crunched the data, the program emails both of us with the outputs. Each email contains two distinct sections: the estimates and the summary. The estimates are the metrics related to the next anticipated bottle (feed time and milk quantity) and they've been pretty accurate so far. The summary includes things like average total daily intake / average feed size / average time between feeds / etc. It's just something I threw in to give us some trending insight, but it's turned out to be immensely helpful -- particularly when answering questions at the pediatrician's office.

**ADMIN/SETUP**

The program is 100% Python, but it does include some non-standard libraries: gkeepapi and pandas. Unfortunately, Google doesn't support API access for Google Keep (why not??) and we weren't willing to change the way we log data. But luckily [gkeepapi](https://github.com/kiwiz/gkeepapi) exists, and that has proven to work great. The downside is that frequently accessing the Keep note through unofficial means caused Google to regularly prompt me to verify my account activity, which got *very* old *very* quickly. To mitigate that, I added a feature in the program to only check the note when there's likely to be new information there. Since adding that, Google has stopped bugging me about it.

Using Launchd, I've scheduled the program to run every ten minutes. It can obviously be run manually as well, but it can be run as often as desired. Even if it's run very frequently, it won't access the Keep note or send an email unless there's likely to be new data to consider.

One goal for this project was that the Google Keep note wouldn't have to change formats from what we'd been doing from the start (we wanted to keep formatting the note lines in the way that was easiest/most intuitive for us). As a result, the format which will allow the program to interpret dates/times/quantities is somewhat rigid. Anyone who uses the program will need to emulate our log style or rewrite the code which extracts data. Another goal for the project was that I'd get some pandas practice in. I admit that pandas was likely overkill for this application, but I wanted to get some experience using it and this project has definitely helped me with the basics.

**NOTES**

The mins/maxes for the time between feeds and the quantities of milk are based on standards for the baby's age (stored in age\_info.txt). My son has been fairly consistent/normal with his feeds, so the generally accepted mins/maxes work just fine. But if -- for example -- a baby wanted to eat every hour, the minimum milk quantity per feed would probably be too much.

Since I made this project for my own use and don't really expect other people to use it, there are some hardcoded values. Nothing major -- just people's names for the email, and the note ID for accessing the Google Keep note.

366,Automated My Job for the First Time,1332,izdclm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/izdclm/automated_my_job_for_the_first_time/,139,1601009661.0,"So this just happened today. I've been learning Python on and off for a long time. I had to take a couple of classes for my undergrad a couple years back, and after that, I never really needed to apply it in my job.

Fast forward to today, my manager was complaining about how many requests for test data the business team was giving him. He tasked me with helping him generate the data using Excel and advanced SQL logic.

I decided to dust off my rusty Python scripting knowledge and created a script that automated the entire process. It took many hours, a lot of googling and 2 mugs of coffee, but I accomplished what I set out to do. My script was able to generate nearly 5000 queries in less than a minute.

Needless to say, my boss was impressed by my initiative, and I've found out first hand how useful knowing Python is. I want to thank this subreddit for being so supportive and always promoting new learning resources. Automate the Boring Stuff is a gold mine of info and I am more motivated than ever before to expand my skills and knowledge!

**Edit:** Wow! I never really expected this post to blow up like it did. Thank you all for the awards. Never really gotten any of them before, as I mostly lurk and don't post. Yesterday was an anomaly because I just felt grateful for subs like this one. I just wanted to take the time to clarify some things.

To those people who are worried about my boss' reaction, don't be. I am extremely lucky to have a boss who cares for all his employees (even me, the part timer with very little IT experience). To give a bit of background, he and my father are friends, so he's taken me under his wing, teaching me how to handle myself in a professional environment and helping my career by exposing me to new opportunities within the project we 're working on. Needless to say, over the past few months, I've been assigned many different tasks on both the business and engineering side, learning a lot in the process that will be invaluable to my career in the future.

Regarding an increase in pay, I've put in the paperwork to go full time, and I gained his approval a few weeks back because of how much effort I put in to making sure I completed my tasks to the best of my abilities. I think this ensured that he would back me up 100% if anyone tried to object. Hopefully by the beginning of October, I'll be billing for 40 hours instead of 24.

I love the team and company I work for, as everyone is super friendly and willing to help me out. Also, part of the reason I automated this task was because it helps my boss politically. I'm not too well-versed in office politics, but he's been giving me lessons on how to handle it. By being able to provide thousands of data points for the business team, he now has them on the back foot and they have to work hard to fulfill their end of the testing, otherwise they're going to be the ones with egg on their face if the issue gets escalated to the executive levels.

I only had two mugs of coffee because my mom yelled at me for drinking coffee late at night and banned me from the kitchen. :D

Classifying these web pages on the internet is a very important aspect to provide the user with a safe browsing experience.   


The objective of this project is to classify the web pages into two categories *Malicious\[Bad\]* and *Benign\[Good\]*  webpages.  Exploratory Data Analysis and Geospatial Data Analysis are done to get more insights and knowledge about the data. Features are engineered and the data is preprocessed accordingly. A total of four ML  and DL models are trained. The models are **XGBoost**, **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Tree** and **Deep Neural Network**. The DNN is implemented in PyTorch and the others are implemented using scikit learn.

I work as an Accountant and last week my Manager let me know that due to a Government audit we would be required to fully itemise our government funding client statements. 

The problem is that our client statement involve charges from third party companies who are paid from this government funding and all these invoices are held on a third party website. 

The third party website said they couldn't help and it was determined that due to how slow the website is as well as other factors (the invoices are all listed as individual download links, some invoices are password protected pdf's, some are jpg's, the website layout is terrible) that it would require 160-180 hours of manual work and therefore a new admin person would need to be hired.

So I wrote something in Python that opens a headless browser, grabs all client names, then goes through each clients account and downloads every invoice, skips any client with no invoices, converts all jpg's to pdf's and resizes them so they fit correctly on the page and merges all invoices into one file per client to form our new statement file.

It takes about about an hour to create 800 statements from 6000 invoices, about half of that time being due to how slow the website is but I'm pretty happy with it and it can now do in a lunch break what we were preparing to hire an entirely new person to do.

I'm still a beginner with Python but I feel like this was a good step in the right direction.

This did make me wonder though, how is it that jobs that are almost fully admin and could be automated are still so common. I remember about ten years ago all I ever heard in school was that automation was going to kill these jobs but it doesn't really seem to have made much progress.",2021-01-08 21:42:30

Please be extra careful when you see Kite (the program auto-completor app). This app is atrociously bad for performance, it  spreads to all of your system (and I mean ALL of your system), and the developers intentionally made it hard for you to remove it. I made the mistake of installing it when I was trying out Spyder IDE. I didn't realize this app installed itself across all of my editors, including neovim. I started noticing that my neovim would get several seconds of hiccup when I was running  python REPL, which had never happened before. Soon my Linux system started experiencing severe hiccup as well. Then I did some profiling and found out that Kite was making background process calls without my consent. The  worst part yet is they made it nearly impossible for you uninstall it, not unless you download their shady app manager or make a curl call to a completely unknown api server just to uninstall apps on your computer. I don't even want to know what kind of personal information / data that they were stealing from my computer. I fail to see how Kite is different from a virus. Please use extra caution when going through IDE setup as something like Kite can easily creep in and contaminate your whole system just like that. To the developers of Spyder and VSCode and other IDEs, please take active step in banning an app like Kite that severely infringes upon the privacy and right of their users. By promoting this app as an extension, you are potentially endangering millions of your users!

EDIT on 9/13/2021:

I wanted to attach my comment response to juliusc (maintainer of Spyder) to the main post, as it echoes my core concerns. I want to thank juliusc for responding to this post.

**Hi juliusc,**

**First of all, I want to thank you for engaging this post and responding to my concerns. I took some time to collect my thoughts and just wanted to share them with you and other developers of popular development tools like Spyder, VSCode, Atom etc. By no means am I trying to single out Spyder, and I want you to know that I deeply appreciate all the work that you guys have done to empower everyone by democratizing better development tools.**

**I would like to point out though, that there was nothing ""light"" about the promotion of Kite in Spyder. As me and other users have noted, Kite installation during the initialization setup of Spyder was an opt-out by default. I am sure many people either clicked through the setup and installed Kite without reading the ""fine-prints"" as is totally reasonable for an average user, and/or they mistakenly assumed that Kite is a safe and secure plugin that had been vetted by the Spyder developers, as it's one of the first things that you see when you start using Spyder. Without sounding accusatory, I was very disappointed that the Spyder developers allowed this to happen. Since I haven't been monitoring your git tracker issues related to Kite (because frankly it's not my job), I will take your word for it that not many Spyder users raised my concern. But anyone who just googles Kite will quickly discover that Kite had severe security/privacy concerns, was an invasive software, and its company conducted extremely questionable business practices in other open source packages as far back as 2017. In fact, the very same announcement post of Kite's sponsorship of Spyder in 2019 already had several users that raised their concerns in the comments section (**[**https://www.spyder-ide.org/blog/spyder-kite-funding/**](https://www.spyder-ide.org/blog/spyder-kite-funding/)**). I don't think it's fair to say that well since the users didn't find any issue and complained about them on git, then we will let it slide. I get that you guys are maintaining/developing Spyder for all of us for free, but I also uphold you to a higher standard because a single bad commit or decision by you can lead to disproportional effects on the rest of us. And sometimes these effects take a while for us to find out and may have irreversible and disastrous consequences. I truly beseech you to be truthful with us and with yourselves, whether if corporate sponsorship, financial or otherwise, means that you can lower the standard that you hold for software integration, even if it comes at the cost of your users. Because if that is the case, then it's a slippery slope to the end of free and open source development as we know it.**

**Okay, enough of a long rant. Thank you for reading it.**

**update**: the book is now free forever!
Here's the link: [https://gumroad.com/l/pydonts](https://gumroad.com/l/pydonts).

When 2021 started, I started publishing a weekly series on my blog on how to write more Pythonic code. This “Pydont's” series is, and will always be, available for free on my blog for everyone to read: [https://mathspp.com/blog/pydonts](https://mathspp.com/blog/pydonts).

However, to make it more convenient for everyone to read all the articles and to create something more formal, I decided to also publish the collection of articles as a book.
You can get the book for free if you use this coupon code: [https://gumroad.com/l/pydonts/w99ucle](https://gumroad.com/l/pydonts/w99ucle).

The series of articles is still ongoing, as I release a new article every week. Therefore, the book will be updated as these new articles come out.
I am also considering adding a little something _only_ in the book, but I haven't decided what I will be doing, so feel free to drop your suggestions in the comments below!

I am really, really excited to share this with you, as sharing knowledge is one of my life's greatest passions! I hope you can download the book and learn something from it :) Be sure to let me know your feedback.

**Edit**: the feedback has been overwhelming and I am humbled by your support! Thank you so much :) I would love to get some testimonials to add to the book page, so if you have anything to say that I could use, please email me (contacts in the blog) or send me a DM over Reddit!

Ultimate Python study guide for newcomers and professionals alike. 🐍 🐍 🐍

    print(""Ultimate Python study guide"")

I created a GitHub repo to share what I've learned about [core Python](https://www.python.org/) over the past 5+ years of using it as a college graduate, an employee at large-scale companies and an open-source contributor of repositories like [Celery](https://github.com/celery/celery) and [Full Stack Python](https://github.com/mattmakai/fullstackpython.com). I look forward to seeing more people learn Python and pursue their passions through it. 🎓

Here are the primary goals of creating this guide:

🏆 **Serve as a resource** for Python newcomers who prefer to learn hands-on. This repository has a collection of standalone modules which can be run in an IDE like [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and in the browser like [Repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/python3). Even a plain old terminal will work with the examples. Most lines have carefully crafted comments which guide a reader through what the programs are doing step-by-step. Users are encouraged to modify source code anywhere as long as the mainroutines are not deleted and [run successfully](https://github.com/huangsam/ultimate-python/blob/master/runner.py) after each change.

🏆 **Serve as a pure guide** for those who want to revisit core Python concepts. Only [builtin libraries](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) are leveraged so that these concepts can be conveyed without the overhead of domain-specific concepts. As such, popular open-source libraries and frameworks are not installed. However, reading the source code in these frameworks is inspiring and highly encouraged if your goal is to become a true [Pythonista](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pythonista).",2020-09-06 08:00:22

Among a lot of new additions I would say that one of the greatest updates that came is improvement of error messages. Not only are they now much better at locating the error, they are now even more descriptive. And what's cooler is that they are now also suggestive. 

Example:

if x = 2

Earlier: SyntaxError: invalid syntax

Now: SyntaxError: cannot assign to attribute here. Maybe you meant ""=="" instead of ""=""?


And it would even try to see if there is a similarly named variables, if you typed in wrong name. 

Example (from notes):

\>\>\> schwarzschild_black_hole = None

\>\>\> schwarschild_black_hole

... NameError: name 'schwarschild_black_hole' is not defined. Did you mean: schwarzschild_black_hole?


Huge appreciation to Pablo Galindo who contributed to all these error message improvements!

If you like stocks and are careful with the way you spend your money, (me saying it seems counter-intuitive given that I bought GME at the peak, I know) you know how much time goes into buying shares of a stock.

You need to: Find stocks that are somehow undervalued; Research on the company, and its competitors; Check that the financials are healthy; Look into different technical indicators; Investigate SEC fillings and Insider activity; Look up for next earnings date and analysts estimates; Estimate market’s sentiment through Reddit, Twitter, Stocktwits; Read news;. … the list goes on.

It’s tedious and I don’t have 24k for a Bloomberg terminal. Which led me to the idea during xmas break to spend the time creating my own terminal. I introduce you to “Gamestonk Terminal” (probably should’ve sent 1 tweet everyday to Elon Musk for copyrights permission eheh).

As someone mentioned, this is meant to be like a swiss army knife for finance. It contains the following functionalities:

* **Discover Stocks:** Some features are: Top gainers; Sectors performance; upcoming earnings releases; top high shorted interest stocks; top stocks with low float; top orders on fidelity; and some SPAC websites with news/calendars.
* **Market Sentiment:** Main features are: Scrolling through Reddit main posts, and most tickers mentions; Extracting trending symbols on stocktwits, or even stocktwit sentiment based on bull/bear flags; Twitter in-depth sentiment prediction using AI; Google mentions over time.
* **Research Web pages:** List of good pages to do research on a stock, e.g. macroaxis, zacks, macrotrends, ..
* **Fundamental Analysis:** Read financials from a company from Market Watch, Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, and Financial Modeling Prep API. Since I only rely on free data, I added the information from all of these, so that the user can get it from the source it trusts the most. Also exports management team behind stock, along with their pages on Google, to speed up research process.
* **Technical Analysis:** The usual technical indicators: sma, rsi, macd, adx, bbands, and more.
* **Due Diligence:** It has several features that I found to be really useful. Some of them are: Latest news of the company; Analyst prices and ratings; Price target from several analysts plot over time vs stock price; Insider activity, and these timestamps marked on the stock price historical data; Latest SEC fillings; Short interest over time; A check for financial warnings based on Sean Seah book.
* **Prediction Techniques:** The one I had more fun with. It tries to predict the stock price, from simple models like sma and arima to complex neural network models, like LSTM. The additional capability here is that all of these are easy to configure. Either through command line arguments, or even in form of a configuration file to define your NN.
* **Reports**: Allows you to run several jobs functionalities and write daily notes on a stock, so that you can assess what you thought about the stock in the past, to perform better decisions.
* **Comparison Analysis**: Allows you to compare stocks.
* **On the ROADMAP**: Cryptocurrencies, Portfolio Analysis, Credit Analysis. Feel free to add the features you'd like and we would happily work on it.

NOTE: This project will always remain open-source, and the idea is that it can grow substantially over-time so that more and more people start taking advantage of it.

I hope you find this useful, and even contribute to the project! The installation guidelines are in a much better state now, so it should be much easier to install and play with it.

Thanks!

I asked you people if you are interested in learning Python by writing a Reddit bot some time back on r/learnprogramming. I received immense number of responses, so I'm posting it on r/python. It covers the process, practices and tools involved in writing a Reddit bot in Python.

Please post your feedback and questions in comments, and I'll be happy to answer them.

#**Requirements**:

1. You are somewhat familiar with programming in general, and have an idea about Python or other languages (like what are variables etc)
2. You  are on a Unix-like system with access to command line tools
3. Familiarity with [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Github](https://github.com/) (Not really required...it is better if you are familiar)
4. A Reddit account

Even if you don't meet these requirements...no need to worry!

#**Introduction**

Writing a bot for Reddit is easier than you think, because Reddit provides a structured method to access its data via the [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api). There are amazing tools like [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which can help simplify the process. PRAW is a Python wrapper for Reddit, and it takes the pain out of the process of writing a bot.


And as I said earlier, Python is an great language, which is easy to grasp for beginners. What even more amazing is it's community, which has made incredible open-source tools and libraries for almost anything. We will be using some of those, and you will realise how useful they are!

#**Important information - Please read**

1. While this post will cover a variety of programming topics, I highly encourage you to explore more. Go ahead and read the documentation of libraries used and think about how can you improve something in your project. I will possibly add more topics to this post.

2. Please **DO NOT CREATE SPAM** by letting your bot run on all of Reddit before you have thoroughly tested it. **r/test** exists for you to do all sorts of testing with your bot...please use it. Refer to [botiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/bottiquette) and keeping in mind the type of bot you create, comply with the guidelines.

#**The code and resources**

I jus wrote a bot for Reddit, which posts a textual explanation of the popular webcomic [xkcd](https://www.xkcd.com) whenever it encounters an xkcd link. It is named **explainxkcdbot**. As of now, I have set my bot to run on r/test only to let you people test it all you want.


You can find the complete source code on my Github page - 
**https://github.com/aydwi/explainxkcdbot**

Here is the code for the bot -
**https://github.com/aydwi/explainxkcdbot/blob/master/explainxkcdbot.py**


#**How to run the bot**

The process is given here - https://github.com/aydwi/explainxkcdbot/blob/master/README.md

If you have any problems in running the bot, please let me know in the comments.


#**Let us begin**

We will move forward step-by-step in the code, and see what is going on.

##Section 1 - Importing libraries


https://gist.github.com/aydwi/e5e4f294b66adf1cb025a70a0392f847


This is the beginning of the program. Any line which begins with a `#` sign is a comment in Python, so it is not interpreted as code. Then we import the essential libraries required for out program. These libraries contain the methods (or functions) which we will use throughout our program. The syntax is pretty straightforward. Next we see 3 variables with some values assigned to them. More on them later.


##Section 2 - Authenticating


https://gist.github.com/aydwi/b941d04d8128e415d6630e961cc97988


This is where important things begin. Before proceeding, you should have a basic idea of what are **[classes](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html)** and **[methods](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3786881/what-is-a-method-in-python)** in Python. One more important thing is an **object** - it is an instance of class, which holds the data variables declared in class and the **member functions work on these objects**. Please make a comment if you do not understand, I will try to explain.


`def authenticate():` defines a function which will try to authenticate the bot to Reddit. This is where PRAW comes into play as it provides us methods to do this. Remember we created a *praw.ini* file earlier. It is a configuration file that stores authentication credentials, so that you just call it whenever needed.


Next, we pass authentication parameters to `praw.Reddit()`. Here `explainbot` refers to the credentials in the configuration file, and `user_agent` is a descriptive string about your script/bot. This returns a [Reddit instance](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_overview/reddit_instance.html), which we assign to the variable `reddit`, and use this variable whenever we wish to authenticate.


Next up, we make a print statement to see who is getting authenticated i.e. the name. The `user` class in PRAW provides methods for the currently authenticated user. We call the method `me()` on `user` and then call it on the variable holding the Reddit instance for authentication, which in our case is `reddit`. So the statement becomes `reddit.user.me()`. We just use some [formatting in python](https://pyformat.info/) to print it.


Finally we `return` the variable `reddit`. Now i can use this `authenticate()` function in my program by calling it when I need it, and it will give me the variable `reddit`, which stores the Reddit instance.

------------------------------

**Important note 1:** Why did I create a function? It is because creating functions makes us easy to manage out code. We write separate functions for separate features of the program, and call them wherever needed. This breaks the code into manageable chunks, which makes it easy to read, modify and debug.

------------------------------

##Section 3 - Scraping


https://gist.github.com/aydwi/699123424e7b38da19d62e69339e859c


Next up is the function `def fetchdata(url)`. Notice how this function takes a parameter `url`. We pass this parameter whenever we call this function. The purpose of this function is to scrape/gather the data from the web, in order to post an explanation.


**Now scraping is not a very reliable process**, but sometimes we just have to do it. We go to a website, go through it's HTML source, and extract the text, links etc. that we want. Here we use **[Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/#make-a-request)** library to make a web request, and **[Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)** to extract the data.


`r = requests.get(url)` gives a Response object called `r`. We can get all the information we need from this object. Then we call the method `content` on `r`, and pass it to `soup = BeautifulSoup(r.content, 'html.parser')`, which gives us a `soup` object with which we can retrieve elements of a web page. Read more [here](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/).


Now what happens depends on what are you scraping. Every website has different type of content, and you should go through the HTML to see how can you retrieve what you want. In my case http://explainxkcd.com has it's explanation inside the first few `<p>` tags, so I look for the first `<p>` tag by `tag = soup.find('p')`. Also, immediately after the explanation ends, `<h2>` tag follows, so I know where to stop. Now take a look here-

    while True:
        if isinstance(tag, bs4.element.Tag):
            if tag.name == 'h2':
                break
            if tag.name == 'h3':
                tag = tag.nextSibling
            else:
                data = data + '\n' + tag.text
                tag = tag.nextSibling
        else:
            tag = tag.nextSibling

I continue to look through the tags, and store textual data in a `string` named `data` and move to the next tag. I `break` the process if I encounter `<h2>` because I know that is where explanation ends. The code depends on the structure of website you are scraping. Finally, I return `data`, so that now when I call the function like `fetchdata('http://explainxkcd.com/1024')` for example, it returns me the explanation of comic 1024 as a `string` named `data`.

----------------

**Important note 2:** Scraping is unreliable. If the website changes it's structure, you have to change your code. In this case, it can still include some tags which we don't want. The line `if (tag.name == 'h3')` in the above function is for handling one such unexpected situation I encountered on http://explainxkcd.com. This is why we like to have APIs. 

--------------------------


##Section 4 - Using regular expressions, parsing URLs, handling exceptions and preventing duplicate submissions


https://gist.github.com/aydwi/700db3e46770d13fe89356d0fa4f570d


This function which takes a parameter which is a Reddit instance (remember that Reddit instance from Section 1). Again we use PRAW to get one or more subreddits, and go through their comments. See [here](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_overview/reddit/subreddits.html) and [here](http://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_overview/models/comment.html).

You can pass multiple subreddits like `for comment in reddit.subreddit('test+learnprogramming+pics')`.

**Regular Expressions**: Now I want to extract xkcd links from the comments, so I need to look for a pattern for the URL. xkcd links are of the form `https://www.xkcd.com/[some number]`. So we make use of regular expressions from the `re` library to match the pattern. [More about regular expressions](https://regexone.com/references/python).

    match = re.findall(""https://www.xkcd.com/[0-9]+"", comment.body)
        if match:
            print(""Link found in comment with comment ID: "" + comment.id)
            xkcd_url = match[0]

Here I look for all strings that are like `https://www.xkcd.com/[some number]` using the method `findall` from [user comments](http://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_overview/models/comment.html), and if it matches, it returns a list with the matching URL, and we store our URL in the variable `xkcd_url`.

----------------

**Important note 3:** Try to find out regular expressions (regex) to improve this program. What happens if a user posts 'https://xkcd.com/1024' or http version as 'http://www.xkcd.com/1024'. These are still valid xkcd URLs. There can be some other cases where the URL might be placed between a bunch of symbols in a comment. Try to modify the regex statement so that it can detect these cases as well.

--------------------------


**URL parsing**: Now I have an xkcd URL. I have 2 immediate objectives now- 

Objective 1. To extract the comic number at the end of the URL. We use [urllib.parse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html) for this purpose.

    url_obj = urlparse(xkcd_url)
            xkcd_id = int((url_obj.path.strip(""/"")))

Objective 2. Form a complete **explainxkcd.com** URL, which I will pass as a parameter to the function `fetchdata(url)` (See Section 2)

    myurl = 'http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/' + str(xkcd_id)

Both objectives are thus complete.

**Preventing duplicate submissions and Exception handling**: The bot needs to make sure it replies to every comment only once. There are many methods you can try which include using a separate key-value database like [Memcached](https://memcached.org/), but we will use a simpler approach.


Just create a text file (remember commented.txt), store the comment ID of a comment in it when you  visit a relevant comment, and verify if a comment ID already exists in that file before making new comments. Remember to put the location of the text file in the `path` variable (from Section 1), so that you can pass it to the method `open()`.


Now, what happens when a user makes a comment like 'https://www.xkcd.com/689243348723'. This xkcd does not exist, but the program will extract '689243348723', then form a link like http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/689243348723, and pass it to the function `fetchdata(url)`. Now **the function will return an exception and your program will stop/crash**. You need to take care of these situations.

This is achieved using `try`, `except` and `else` blocks. [See here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html) Here is the code for these 2 steps-

    file_obj_r = open(path,'r')
                        
            try:
                explanation = fetchdata(myurl)
            except:
                print('Exception!!! Possibly incorrect xkcd URL...\n')
                # Typical cause for this will be a URL for an xkcd that does not exist (Example: https://www.xkcd.com/772524318/)
            else:
                if comment.id not in file_obj_r.read().splitlines():
                    print('Link is unique...posting explanation\n')
                    comment.reply(header + explanation + footer)
                    
                    file_obj_r.close()

                    file_obj_w = open(path,'a+')
                    file_obj_w.write(comment.id + '\n')
                    file_obj_w.close()
                else:
                    print('Already visited link...No reply needed\n')


Notice how I make a reply to a relevant comment by using the variables from Section 1 to print header and footer description alongside the explanation - `comment.reply(header + explanation + footer)`


Next we make some `sleep` statements to stop the bot from querying Reddit too fast. If the Reddit API returns an error due to too many requests, adjust `val` in the instances of `time.sleep(val)` in your program.


##Section 5: The main function


https://gist.github.com/aydwi/99323ebd710428f4590077a844236f83


We are almost done here. We wrap our functions into a `main` function by calling `authenticate()` (remember Section 1) and passing it to the function which runs the bot, namely `run_explainbot(reddit)`. Since we are calling it inside `while` loop with the expression 'True', it will run indefinitely.


#My bot in action

[Hosted version](https://getquantbase.com) (how to actually run/invest in it). Folks the amount of y’all that have messaged me asking for this is absolutely AMAZING but I can’t keep up! Posting the link here for you guys

&#x200B;

HOW I DID THIS

Scraped WSB sentiment, got the top + most positively mentioned stocks on WSB (for the better part of this year, that's been $GME and $AMC, recently some $SPCE and $NVDA, and about 13 other stocks. I have the strategy rebalancing monthly. The source code is actually pretty intuitive, but essentially what it uses is VADER ( Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning), which s a model used for text sentiment analysis that is sensitive to both polarity (positive/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotion.

The way it works is by relying on a dictionary that maps lexical (aka word-based) features to emotion intensities -- these are known as sentiment scores. The overall sentiment score of a comment/post is achieved by summing up the intensity of each word in the text.

In some ways, it's easy: words like ‘love’, ‘enjoy’, ‘happy’, ‘like’ all convey a positive sentiment. Also VADER is smart enough to understand the basic context of these words, such as “did not love” as a negative statement. It also understands the emphasis of capitalization and punctuation, such as “ENJOY” which is pretty cool. Phrases like “The acting was good , but the movie could have been better” have sentiments in both polarities, which makes this kind of analysis tricky -- essentially w VADER you would analyze which part of the sentiment here is more intense.

&#x200B;

**Results and some stats:**

Right now I'm up 60% YTD, compared to the SP500's 13% (the recent spikes in GME and AMC have helped tremendously)

\- The strategy is **backtested** only to the beginning of 2020, but I'm working on it. It's got an annualized return of 33% (compared to 16% for the SP500)

\- **Max drawdown of -8.7%** (aka how far it went down before coming back up -- interestingly enough, WallStreetBets weathered COVID pretty well)

&#x200B;

Happy to answer any more questions about the process/results. I think doing stuff like this is pretty cool as someone with a foot in algo trading and traditional financial markets",2021-05-27 13:24:25
461,From complete beginner to django website,1137,kcdfv0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/kcdfv0/from_complete_beginner_to_django_website/,93,1607876740.0,"6 months ago I’d never written a single line of code, in any language. I decided completely out of the blue to do a course on “coding for data analysis”, I very nearly picked one on human biology instead. It was just something to fill the lockdown boredom, but I quickly and unexpectedly started to enjoy it more and more.

Fast forward 3 months and I started learning html and then django. From that the idea to create www.rugbykickoff.com, which has just gone live now. 

I honestly can’t believe how quickly it was to pick the language up with the amount of help available online. 

I lost motivation several times getting completely lost at stack overflow answers where I didn’t understand a single concept etc. But this is testament to persevering and the massive amount of online support that’s available.

I believe that  these notebooks will be more than enough for you to get started in  Python and you might not need to do any other basic Python course  online.

Jupyter Notebook files are available [here](https://github.com/ItsAwSM/Python-for-Data-Analytics).

I also have created videos on the notebooks if you need any added explanation. They are on my channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/c/UtsavAwasthiX/videos)
